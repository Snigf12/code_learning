- [5_phpChallenge](https://github.com/Snigf12/5_phpChallenge) -> Challenge to practice PHP to use a CSV file and display information from that CSV. It is not published cause PHP is a server-side solution and GitHub doesn't support that. It is needed to be deployed in a server directly like Apache or Nginx.
  
- [6_PHP_SQL_Challenge](https://github.com/Snigf12/6_PHP_SQL_Challenge) -> Challenge to use PHP for reading different tables from a Database to update the content in the website. Same as before, wasn't able to deploy the page in GitHub cause it is a PHP solution.

- [7_HTML_CSS_PHP_Javascript_MySQL_Challente](https://github.com/Snigf12/7_HTML_CSS_PHP_Javascript_MySQL_Challente) -> Challenge putting all together and adding a PHP website that updates and input data into a database.
